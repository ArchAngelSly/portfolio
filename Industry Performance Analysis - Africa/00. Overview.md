## **Step-by-Step Methodology**

1.	**Understanding Data Requirements**
o	Project objectives: Reviewed Business Requirements to understand requirements.
o	Metrics: Compiled list of key performance indicators (KPI) to focus on viz  Market Value, Revenue, CAGR (2, 3, and 5 years), and Annual Growth Rates.
o	Selection of data sources: 
	Aranca.com for financial reports and market insights.
	Africa.BusinessInsider.com for region-specific economic and industry data.

2.	**Data Wrangling and Collection**
o	Extracted relevant datasets from the identified platforms into Microsoft Excel formats.
o	Combined multiple datasets into a single master file for further processing.
o	Structured data by assigning clear column headers and aligning formats for consistency.

3.	**Data Cleaning Using Microsoft Excel Power Query**
o	Duplicates: Removed redundant rows for consistency.
o	Missing Data: Replaced missing values with averages or trends interpolation.
o	Data Types: Ensured numerical columns and dates are standardised and formatted correctly.
o	Columns: Renamed columns to apply descriptive and professional column names for better understanding.
o	Validation: Validated and saved the cleaned dataset for Tableau analysis.

4.	**Connecting to Tableau Desktop Public**
o	Imported the cleaned Excel file into Tableau Desktop Public.

5.	**Creating Worksheets in Tableau**
o	Visualisation: Generated appropriate visualisations to show market value vs. revenue for various industries CAGR (3Y), leading and lagging sectors , industries, companies based on CAGR and growth.

6.	**Designing the Dashboard**
o	Arranged visualisations into appropriate dashboards with a focus on readability and user interaction.
o	Added filters for interactive exploration of data by industries, regions, or years.
o	Included tooltips and legends for detailed data interpretation.

7.	**Building a Story in Tableau**
o	Compiled story points with key insights from the dashboard.
o	Added narratives and captions to emphasize findings and trends.
o	Structured the story to guide users through an analytical journey.

8.	**Publishing to Tableau Public**
o	Saved and published the dashboard to Tableau Public.
o	Provided access links for stakeholders to interact with the visualisations.
