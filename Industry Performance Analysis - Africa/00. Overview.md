## **Executive Summary**
This project involved designing and developing a concise and interactive dashboard that provides data-driven insights into industry performance trends for potential investors. By leveraging data from trusted sources, the project used advanced data wrangling and visualisation techniques to highlight market value, revenue trends, and growth metrics such as CAGR and annual growth rates. The dashboard which presents leading and lagging sectors, industries, and companies  was designed to assist investors in making preliminary portfolio decisions as to which industries, sectors or companies to further explore for investment

Key highlights of the project include:

   - Sourcing and consolidating data from **Aranca** and **Business Insider Africa**.<br>
   - Cleaning and transforming data using Microsoft Excel Power Query.<br>
   - Building visualisations in Tableau to explore key performance indicators.<br>
   - Publishing the final dashboard on Tableau Public for easy access by stakeholders.<br>
   
This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualisation, and storytelling, aligning data-driven insights with investor decision-making needs.<br>

## **Step-by-Step Methodology**

1.	**Understanding Data Requirements**<br>

   - **Project objectives:** Reviewed Business Requirements to understand requirements.<br>
   - **Metrics:** Compiled list of key performance indicators (KPI) to focus on viz  Market Value, Revenue, CAGR (2, 3, and 5 years), and Annual Growth Rates.<br>
   - **Selection of data sources:** <br>
      - **Aranca.com** for financial reports and market insights.<br>
      - **Africa.BusinessInsider.com** for region-specific economic and industry data.<br>

2.	**Data Wrangling and Collection**<br>

   - Extracted relevant datasets from the identified platforms into Microsoft Excel formats.<br>
   - Combined multiple datasets into a single master file for further processing.<br>
   - Structured data by assigning clear column headers and aligning formats for consistency.<br>

3.	**Data Cleaning Using Microsoft Excel Power Query**<br>

   - **Duplicates** Removed redundant rows for consistency.<br>
   - **Missing Data:** Replaced missing values with averages or trends interpolation.<br>
   - **Data Types:** Ensured numerical columns and dates are standardised and formatted correctly.<br>
   - **Columns:** Renamed columns to apply descriptive and professional column names for better understanding.<br>
   - **Validation:** Validated and saved the cleaned dataset for Tableau analysis.<br>

4.	**Connecting to Tableau Desktop Public**<br>

   - Imported the cleaned Excel file into Tableau Desktop Public.<br>

5.	**Creating Worksheets in Tableau**<br>

   - **Visualisation:** Generated appropriate visualisations to show market value vs. revenue for various industries CAGR (3Y), leading and lagging sectors , industries, companies based on CAGR and growth.<br>

6.	**Designing the Dashboard**<br>

   - Arranged visualisations into appropriate dashboards with a focus on readability and user interaction.<br>
   - Added filters for interactive exploration of data by industries, regions, or years.<br>
   - Included tooltips and legends for detailed data interpretation.<br>

7.	**Building a Story in Tableau**<br>

   - Compiled story points with key insights from the dashboard.<br>
   - Added narratives and captions to emphasize findings and trends.<br>
   - Structured the story to guide users through an analytical journey.<br>

8.	**Publishing to Tableau Public**<br>
   
   - Saved and published the dashboard to Tableau Public.<br>
   - Provided access links for stakeholders to interact with the visualisations.<br>

## **Challenges Experienced**

1.	**Data Availability:** Accessing detailed data from the identified sources required manual extraction.<br>
2.	**Data Quality:** Addressing missing values and standardising inconsistent formats was time-intensive.<br>
3.	**Visualisation Complexity:** Designing visuals that effectively balance detail and clarity while remaining user-friendly.<br>
4.	**Performance Optimisation:** Managing Tableau's performance for large datasets required additional effort.<br>
