# Executive Summary
This project aimed to address critical challenges faced by ArchAngel Sports in improving customer engagement, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction. By leveraging data-driven methods, the project focused on identifying underperforming areas in marketing campaigns and customer feedback, thereby guiding actionable strategies to optimise outcomes. The data science lifecycle was utilised to explore SQL Server datasets, analyse performance metrics, and provide business recommendations through dashboards and visualisations.
Key Achievements:
•	Analysed conversion trends, highlighting drop-off points and seasonal impacts.
•	Evaluated customer engagement across various content types and platforms.
•	Conducted sentiment analysis of customer feedback to identify pain points and opportunities.
The project culminated in actionable insights, including strategies to boost high-performing product sales, optimise content strategies, and address mixed and negative feedback for improved customer satisfaction.

# Methodology
The project followed a structured, step-by-step data science workflow:
## 1. Business Understanding
•	Objective: Define goals to enhance conversion rates, customer engagement, and feedback scores.
•	Inputs: Project objectives, key performance indicators (KPIs), and business challenges.
•	Tools Used: PowerPoint for stakeholder communication.
•	Outputs: Clear project goals and alignment with business expectations.
## 2. Data Understanding
•	What Was Done: Explored SQL Server databases and CSV files to identify relevant data attributes.
•	Inputs: SQL Server database tables and external CSV datasets.
•	Tools Used: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Python libraries (pandas, pyodbc).
•	Outputs: Initial summary of data structure, completeness, and potential use cases.
## 3. Data Preparation
•	What Was Done: Cleaned and transformed raw data into analysable formats.
•	Inputs: Raw data tables, customer feedback text, and social media metrics.
•	Tools Used: Python (pandas for cleaning, nltk for sentiment analysis).
•	Code Generated: Scripts for data extraction and cleaning
•	Outputs: Cleaned datasets in CSV format.
## 4. Modelling and Analysis
•	What Was Done: Performed sentiment analysis and evaluated content performance.
•	Inputs: Cleaned data, customer feedback text, marketing metrics.
•	Tools Used: Python (nltk, pandas, pyodbc ), Power BI for dashboards.
•	Code Generated: Sentiment scoring 
•	Outputs: Sentiment scores, content performance metrics, and trends.
## 5. Deployment
•	What Was Done: Presented insights through Power BI dashboards and visualisations.
•	Inputs: Analysis results, visual trends.
•	Tools Used: Power BI, PowerPoint for presentations.
•	Outputs: Interactive dashboards and a comprehensive data presentation.

# Challenges Encountered
The main challenge was the high compute power required for executing Pandas profiling directly on the dataset hosted on SQL Server. The process often caused system crashes due to insufficient resources.
**Solution:**
•	Compiled a Python script to download tables locally for profiling
•	Conducted profiling on local storage, which resolved the issue.
