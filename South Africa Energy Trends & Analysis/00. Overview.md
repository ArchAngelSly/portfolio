## **Project Overview: South African Energy Trends (2014–2023) – Power BI Dashboard**  

### **1. Executive Summary**  
This project provides a **comprehensive analysis of South Africa’s energy trends** from 2014 to 2023, leveraging **Microsoft Power BI** to visualise key insights into **energy consumption, primary energy generation, renewable energy growth, and the role of nuclear power.** The data was sourced from top-rated global energy databases, cleaned using **Power Query in Excel**, and further transformed in **Power BI** using **DAX calculations**. The final dashboard, hosted on **Power BI Service**, enables interactive exploration of **South Africa’s ever-changing energy landscape and outlook**.  

### **2. Step-by-Step Methodology**  
#### **Data Sourcing & Wrangling**  
- **Data collected from leading global energy databases**, including:  
  1. **Energy Institute** ([www.energyinst.org]((https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review))) – Statistical Review of Global energy and CO₂ data.  
  2. **International Energy Agency (IEA)** ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org)) – Energy policy and statistical insights.  
  3. **Our World In Data** ([www.ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/energy)) – Annual global energy reports.  
- **Data wrangled using Power Query in Excel** to clean, transform, and structure datasets.  

#### **Data Processing & Transformation in Power BI**  
- Data uploaded to **Power BI Desktop** and further refined using **Power Query Editor**.  
- **DAX calculations applied** to create calculated date tables to enhance aggregations for deeper insights.  

#### **Dashboard Development**  
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard built**, featuring:  
  - **Trend analysis** of energy consumption and generation.  
  - **Comparative insights** on coal, renewables, and nuclear energy.  
  - **Custom visuals and KPIs** to highlight key patterns.  
- **Dashboard deployed to Power BI Service**, ensuring accessibility for broader audiences.  

### **3. Challenges Experienced**  
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Variations in energy reporting metrics across sources required **careful standardisation and cleaning**.  
- **Handling Missing Data**: Addressed using **interpolation techniques and calculated columns in Power BI**.  
- **Optimising Dashboard Performance**: Managed large datasets efficiently by leveraging **DAX optimisations and query folding in Power Query**.  

### **4. Summary of Skills and Experience Practiced**  
a. **Data Wrangling & Cleaning** – Power Query in Excel & Power BI.  
b. **Data Modeling & Transformation** – DAX calculations, aggregations, and performance tuning.  
c. **Business Intelligence & Dashboarding** – Creating interactive and visually compelling reports in Power BI.  
d. **Storytelling with Data** – Extracting meaningful insights to inform decision-making in the energy sector.  

This project enabled me to showcase my ability to **source, clean, analyse, and visualise large datasets**, demonstrating strong **data analytics and business intelligence expertise.**
