### **1. Executive Summary**  
This project provides a **detailed analysis of South Africaâ€™s energy trends** from 2014 to 2023, leveraging **Power BI** to visualise key insights into **energy consumption, primary energy generation, renewable energy growth, and the role of nuclear power.** The data was sourced from top-rated global energy databases, cleaned using **Power Query in Excel**, and further transformed in **Power BI** using **DAX calculations**. The final dashboard, hosted on **Power BI Service**, enables interactive exploration of **South Africaâ€™s evolving energy landscape**.  

### **2. Step-by-Step Methodology**  
#### **Data Sourcing & Wrangling**  
- **Data collected from leading global energy databases**, including:  
  1. **Enerdata** ([www.enerdata.net](https://www.enerdata.net)) â€“ Global energy and COâ‚‚ data.  
  2. **International Energy Agency (IEA)** ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org)) â€“ Energy policy and statistical insights.  
  3. **BP Statistical Review of World Energy** ([www.bp.com](https://www.bp.com)) â€“ Annual global energy reports.  
- **Data wrangled using Power Query in Excel** to clean, transform, and structure datasets.  

#### **Data Processing & Transformation in Power BI**  
- Data uploaded to **Power BI Desktop** and further refined using **Power Query Editor**.  
- **DAX calculations applied** to create calculated columns, measures, and aggregations for deeper insights.  

#### **Dashboard Development**  
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard built**, featuring:  
  - **Dynamic trend analysis** of energy consumption and generation.  
  - **Comparative insights** on coal, renewables, and nuclear energy.  
  - **Custom visuals and KPIs** to highlight key patterns.  
- **Dashboard deployed to Power BI Service**, ensuring accessibility for broader audiences.  

### **3. Challenges Experienced**  
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Variations in energy reporting metrics across sources required **careful standardization and cleaning**.  
- **Handling Missing Data**: Addressed using **interpolation techniques and calculated columns in Power BI**.  
- **Optimizing Dashboard Performance**: Managed large datasets efficiently by leveraging **DAX optimizations and query folding in Power Query**.
